# Yext State of GTM App

This Streamlit app is a tool for cleaning, enhancing, and reporting data that you've downloaded from Salesforce. The app is designed to be user-friendly and simple to use.

## How to Use the App

Follow the steps below to use the Yext Streamlit App:

1. **Download the Report**: First, you'll need to download the relevant report from Salesforce. You can find the report at the following link: [Salesforce Report](https://yext.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Report/00O4X000009eyKuUAI/view?queryScope=userFolders). Once you're at the report, download it as a CSV file.
2. **Upload the CSV File**: Next, open the Streamlit app. You'll see an option to upload a file. Choose the CSV file you just downloaded from Salesforce.
3. **Data Processing**: Once you've uploaded the CSV file, the app will automatically clean and enhance the data. This step is handled entirely by the app, so you don't need to worry about it!
4. **Generate Pivot Reports**: After the data processing step, the app will allow you to create pivot reports. These are simplified, easy-to-understand reports based on the cleaned and enhanced data.
5. **Download and Use Your Reports**: Finally, you can download the pivot reports and add them to your Google Sheets for further use and analysis.
